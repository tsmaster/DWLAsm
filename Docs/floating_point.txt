[Y,A] means Y is the high byte, A is the low byte of the floating point number


ADD     $E7C1   (MFAC) <- (SFAC) + (MFAC)
        MFAC and SFAC already loaded, do the addition

LADD    $E7BE   (MFAC) <- [Y,A] + (MFAC)
        MFAC is already loaded; (Y,A) points to the memory location of
        the packed number to be added to (MFAC)

SUB     $E7AA   (MFAC) <- (SFAC) - (MFAC)
        MFAC and SFAC already loaded, do the subtraction

LSUB    $E7A7   (MFAC) <- [Y,A] - (MFAC)
        MFAC is already loaded; (Y,A) points to the memory location of
        the packed number to have (MFAC) subtracted from it

MULT    $E982   (MFAC) <- (SFAC) * (MFAC)
        MFAC and SFAC already loaded, do the multiplication

LMULT   $E97F   (MFAC) <- [Y,A] * (MFAC)
        MFAC is already loaded; (Y,A) points to the memory location of
        the packed number to be multiplied by (MFAC)

DIV     $EA69   (MFAC) <- (SFAC) / (MFAC)
        MFAC and SFAC already loaded, do the division

LDIV    $EA66   (MFAC) <- [Y,A] / (MFAC)
        MFAC is already loaded; (Y,A) points to the memory location of
        the packed number to be divided by (MFAC)

POWER   $EE97   (MFAC) <- (SFAC)^(MFAC)
